# Public Finance Researcher Assignment
Assignment for Public Finance Researcher position CivicDataLab

### **Background**

Increase visibility into budgets data in India to improve civic participation.

* Citizens have limited access to data on government budgets in India.
* The state budget documents are not easily consumable with detailed information locked in closed formats (PDF, etc.).
* Lack of metadata hinders the process of easy search-ability for relevant fiscal data.
* Restricted public engagement with fiscal data leads constrained public participation with fiscal issues.

### **Objective**

Analysis of Himachal Pradesh state budgetary and district spending expenditure data.

* Comparative analysis for a sector of choice (Primary Education, Public Health or other).
* Identify some key fund flow issues and/or interesting data insights/stories.
* Use open-source softwares like Python, R, LibreOffice Calc or more, to keep the output shareable giving options to collate collaborative feedback.
